# cz4045-project2
Source Code for Project 2 of CZ4045

For this project, there are two questions.
The first is on implementing a neural language model using a feedforward network instead of an RNN.
The second is on Named Entity Recognition (NER). The aim is to see how a CNN can be used as an encoder instead of the bidirectional LSTM which has already been implemented.
The source code for each of the questions are in their respective directories.
The latex file for the report will be in the directory called report. 
The PDF file of the report will also be in that directory.
